		<h3>After a teenager was killed in the Bronx while shooting neighbors with a toy 'water bead' gun, the NYPD joined departments across the country by announcing the toys are banned under existing airsoft gun laws.

<div class="container">
    <p>This summer, a new toy craze has met with tragedy and legal challenges across the city and the country.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In Concourse, a man allegedly harassed a Bronx cop in late July by pointing an &lsquo;Orbeez&rsquo; gun, loaded with water-filled gel balls, at an officer and shouting at him. He was arrested for attempted assault on July 23rd, just one day after the tragic killing of a teenager in Mount Hope, 18-year-old Raymound Chaluisant.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Chaluisant was fatally shot by an off-duty corrections officer when the officer &lsquo;returned fire&rsquo; with a real gun after Chaluisant hit him with a water bead in the back. New York police immediately began to post about the kind of toy weapon that had been found near Chaluisant&rsquo;s body, calling them out as unsafe and threatening confiscation and summons&rsquo; for anyone who used one.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One gel blaster brand has garnered some unsolicited attention: the SPLATRBALL blaster was used as an example of illegal gel blasters in NYPD posts about them following Chaluisant&rsquo;s death. The police have emphasized the danger of the toy weapons, but what are they really?</p>

        <p>Unlike the spring-powered mechanical magazines used in other imitation guns, toy gel bead blasters like the SPLATRBALL have a small electronic magazine that feeds the beads up into the gun's mechanisms to fire.</p>

        <p>The 'orbeez' style 'ammo' for the SPLATRBALL starts out tiny and expands over 4 hours in water. When fired, the water beads explode on impact, causing minimal damage.</p>

        <p>The SPLATRBALL has a spring piston gearbox mechanism similar to the gearboxes used in airsoft guns, but with larger clearances for the 'Orbeez' style water bead ammo and plastic nylon gears and components.</p>
        <p>SPLATRBALL advertises a muzzle velocity of 200 feet per second. A knob selector allows you to switch between auto and semi-auto firing.</p>

    <p>In New York City, the ban on toy guns like these comes from <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-6218">&sect; 10-131(b)</a> in the New York City Administrative Code&rsquo;s regulations on firearms. Air pistols, air rifles or any similar device &ldquo;in which the propelling force is a spring or air&rdquo; are illegal to sell or possess in the city without a license from the commissioner of the New York Police Department.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>City code allows for the possibility of a licensing process &mdash; and sets an annual fee for licensing &mdash; but there&rsquo;s no public ap plication or formal licensing process in the city for this kind of toy gun.</p>

    <p>Automatic electric gun (AEG) style water bead blasters like the SPLATRBALL have lower-caliber versions of the kind of gearboxes used in normal electric airsoft guns, just using nylon gears and modified electric magazine feed and barrel sizing adjustments to accommodate their squishy ammo. Like AEG airsoft guns, they have an internal motor inside a gearbox that loads an air pump piston against a spring. When the spring releases, the piston plunger is pushed forward through a cylinder and the water bead pushed up through the magazine is shot through the barrel.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So, for all that blasters like these are toys with relatively harmless ammo and are unlikely to cause serious injury used as-instructed, they definitely do fall under the administrative code&rsquo;s definition banning guns where &ldquo;the propelling force is a spring or air.&rdquo;&nbsp; So &mdash; why do kids in New York City have them, if they&rsquo;re illegal to buy, sell, or own?</p>

    <p>On Amazon and other online stores, water bead blasters like the SPLATRBALL, Omoqia Toy&rsquo;s MP-9 Gel Ball Blaster, or the Gel Blaster SURGE are exploding in popularity, and they&rsquo;re surprisingly easy to get a hold of.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="container">

    <p>For some reason, despite not firing any kind of foam projectile, most of these water bead blasters are listed &mdash; and ranked &mdash; in Amazon&rsquo;s Toy Foam Blasters category under Toys and Games, like a NERF foam dart gun. Gel blasters aren&rsquo;t foam dart guns, but they&rsquo;re outranking many of those toys in their own category. Four gel blasters cracked the top ten best selling &ldquo;toy foam blasters&rdquo; on Amazon in August. Seventeen total made the site&rsquo;s top 50, most with hundreds or thousands of reviews.</p>
    <p>Amazon knows that air and spring powered guns are banned for sale, shipping, and possession in New York City &mdash; or at least, the company is aware of enough city regulations restricting their sale that they will not ship guns in the airsoft category within New York. If you try, they serve you a red-text error message warning you that the item you&rsquo;ve picked can&rsquo;t be shipped to your location. But try to order most of the banned gel blasters on the site into the city, categorized as they are in the toys sections, and Amazon promises next-day delivery.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Within Amazon&rsquo;s seller guidelines on restricted products, the company explicitly notes that airsoft guns, toy guns and guns marketed as air or spring driven are subject to geographic sales restrictions, but many of the gel blasters listed on the site are completely unrestricted, flying under the radar despite their recent popularity.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Promoted significantly within Amazon&rsquo;s New Releases, Best Sellers, and recommendations features and with no warnings on product pages that these colorful toys qualify as airsoft guns and are illegal in certain jurisdictions, families may buy them as gifts or new toys completely ignorant to where they fall within NYC code &ndash; and Amazon fulfills those orders, leaving those families unknowingly violating the law and putting their children at risk.&nbsp;</p>
